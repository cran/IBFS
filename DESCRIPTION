Description: The initial basic feasible solution (IBFS) is a significant step to achieve the minimal total cost (optimal solution) of the transportation problem. However, the existing methods of IBFS do not always provide a good feasible solution which can reduce the number of iterations to find the optimal solution. This initial basic feasible solution can be obtained by using any of the following methods. 
             a) North West Corner Method. 
             b) Least Cost Method. 
             c) Row Minimum Method. 
             d) Column Minimum Method. 
             e) Vogel's Approximation Method.
             etc.
